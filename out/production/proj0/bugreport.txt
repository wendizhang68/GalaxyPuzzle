\f0\fs24 \cf0 Dear Staffs:\
Basically my bug is that when I play the game, sometimes when I put the boundary and form a region, the area does not turn from grey to white. Also when I solved the puzzle, there is no red sign \'93solved\'94. I passed all unit tests. For hidden tests, I passed 3 out of 10. I did not pass 01-region, 02-region,03 to 10. Now I do not have any hint on where should I begin to fix now and what potential problems do I have. Could you give me any hints?\
Thanks a lot!}
